	//Converting sub class into super class called upcasting.

	//upcasting exists only when inheritance is there.
	
//Syntax:-
	//parentclass  refvarname=new childclass();

//Downcasting:-
	
	//Converting super class into sub class called upcasting.

	//Before performing downcasting,upcasting must be  performed.
	
//Syntax:-
		//childclass  refvarname=(childclass)new parentclass();
	
	//though the above syntax is supported in java but the Downcasting concept is not supported in java.
	
	
	//Downcasting is same as Upcasting so -->Downcasting concept is not supported in java
	
	//syntax of inheritance and syntaax of downcasting is same so-->Downcasting concept is not supported in java
	
	//concept ususally same -->Downcasting concept is not supported in java

//Generalization concept in java:-
	
	//Extracting all the common and important properties from all the classes and
	          //declared them in a super file is called "Generalization".
	
	
	//Example :- ATM machine
